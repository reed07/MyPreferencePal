            <h2>PREMIUM VERSIONS OF THE WEBSITES AND/OR APPLICATIONS</h2>
            <p>MyFitnessPal offers certain premium versions of the Websites, Applications or Services (the “Premium Services”) in exchange for the payment of fees. The Premium Services provide you access to certain enhanced features and
                functionality (e.g., premium graphs and analysis, an ad-free browsing experience, etc.). By signing up for and using the Premium Services, you agree to pay any fees due for and incurred by you in your usage of the Premium
                Services.</p>
            <p>When you sign up for the Premium Services, you must designate and provide information about your preferred payment method (“Payment Method”). You may switch to a different Payment Method or update your information by visiting
                the “Settings” page within the Websites and Applications.</p>
            <p>You may elect to make payment for the Premium Services on a monthly or annual subscription basis. All fees due for the Premium Services are payable in advance. Fees due for the Premium Services will be billed automatically to
                the Payment Method at the start of the monthly or annual subscription period, as applicable, and will auto-renew until you elect to cancel your access to Premium Services. The subscription renewal fees will be the same as
                the initial charges unless you are otherwise notified in advance. You expressly authorize us to charge your Payment Method for the appropriate fees charged for the Premium Services and for any other purchases you elect to
                make via MyFitnessPal.</p>
            <p>We will administer and apply payments you transmit for the Premium Services via the online billing mechanisms of any of our affiliated websites and third party providers in a timely and commercially reasonable manner.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to terminate your access to a Premium Service for any nonpayment of associated charges. If you want to discontinue a Premium Service, then you must cancel that Premium Service per applicable cancellation
                procedure set out <a href="http://myfitnesspal.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/1940192">here</a>. The cancellation of a Premium Service will go into effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will have the
                same level of access to the Premium Service through the remainder of such
                billing cycle. For example, if you are billed on a monthly subscription basis and cancel during a given month, you will be charged for the entirety of that month and maintain access to the Premium Services through the end of
                that month. ALL PURCHASES OF PREMIUM SERVICES ARE FINAL, AND NO REFUND WILL BE GIVEN FOR UNUSED PORTIONS OF ANY PREMIUM SERVICES UPON TERMINATION OR CANCELATION.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to increase fees charged for the Premium Services or to institute new fees at any time upon reasonable notice posted in advance on the Websites and/or Applications. Your only remedy regarding the increase
                of fees or imposition of new fees in connection with the Premium Services is to cancel the Premium Services per the cancellation procedure set out above.</p>

            <h2>GENERAL</h2>
            <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between MyFitnessPal and You concerning Your use of the Services. This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of MyFitnessPal or
                by the unilateral amendment of this Agreement by MyFitnessPal and by the posting by MyFitnessPal of such amended version. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect
                the parties original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive
                such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. MyFitnessPal may assign or transfer this Agreement at any time, with or without notice to You. This Agreement and all of Your rights and obligations hereunder will not
                be assignable or transferable by You without the prior written consent of MyFitnessPal. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. You and

                and suppliers, and would therefore entitle MyFitnessPal or MyFitnessPals licensors or suppliers, as the case may be, to injunctive relief. The headings in this Agreement are for the purpose of convenience only and shall not
