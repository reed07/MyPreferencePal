// DexPatcher Patched Application plugin:

apply plugin: 'com.github.lanchon.dexpatcher.patched-application'

// The DexPatcher Patched Application plugin produces a modified Android application
// by applying changes and additions to code and resources of a source application
// imported as a DexPatcher APK library.

// General Plugin Configuration
dexpatcherConfig {
    // This should point to a local clone of the DexPatcher Gradle plugin support tool
    // repo that is available here: https://github.com/Lanchon/DexPatcher-gradle-tools
    // But instead of defining the directory here, add a 'dexpatcher.dir' entry to the
    // 'local.properties' of the root project. That way it becomes available to all
    // subprojects and the local configuration is not posted to the VCS.
    // dir = '../../../../dexpatcher-gradle-tools-master'

    // Specific Plugin Configuration
    patchedApplication {
        // Speed up debug builds by enabling multi-threaded multi-dex processing for them,
        // but only if multi-dex mode is already enabled for them. Defaults to true.
        //multiDexThreadedForMultiDexDebugBuilds = true

        // Speed up debug builds by enabling multi-threaded multi-dex processing for them,
        // even if multi-dex mode is not already enabled for them. Note that apps patched
        // in multi-dex mode are only compatible with devices running Android 5.0 (API 21)
        // and later. Defaults to false.
        //multiDexThreadedForAllDebugBuilds = true

    // Per-Tool Defaults
    dexpatcher {

        // *** MULTI-DEX TEST ***
        //
        // Note that DexPatcher multi-dex patched apps require an Android 5.0 device or
        // newer to run. This is why the 'minSdkVersion' setting in the android section
        // below was bumped to 21.
        //
        // In this test we patch a multi-dex source app created by artificially limiting
        // the maximum number of method references per dex file. It was created using
        // DexPatcher tool's '--max-dex-pool-size' option.
        //
        // The source project's 'apk-library' plugin is always multi-dex enabled.
        // Multi-dex must be manually enabled in the 'patched-application' plugin:
        multiDex = true
        // Multi-dex need not be enabled in the Android build system unless the patch
        // dex itself requires it. The sizes of the source app and complete patched app are
        // not important.
        //
        // In this test we also limit the number of methods per dex file in the patched app:
        maxDexPoolSize = 10000
        // This forces it to become multi-dex for testing purposes.
        //
        // And finally we enable very verbose logging:
        verbosity = DEBUG
        logStats = true
        // This will show multi-dex I/O in action.

        // The Android api level of dex files. The api level is auto-detected by DexPatcher
        // v1.2.0 and later, so this setting is no longer needed for normal operation.
        //apiLevel = 14

        // Enable multi-dex support. Note that DexPatcher only supports native multi-dex as
        // implemented in ART and does not support legacy multi-dex for Dalvik VM. Patched
        // multi-dex apps are only compatible with Android 5.0 (API 21) and later devices.
        //multiDex = true

        // Enable multi-threaded multi-dex processing, if multi-dex mode is already enabled.
        // Multi-threaded processing is faster but produces more dex files than the bare
        // minimum required by the contents of the patched app. This is recommended for
        // debug builds but not for releases.
        //multiDexThreaded = true

        // Set the number of multi-dex processing threads, if multi-threaded multi-dex mode
        // is already enabled. Defaults to the number of available processors up to 4.
        //multiDexJobs = 8

        // The maximum number of items in the pools of the output dex files. This limits,
        // for example, the number of method references in each dex file. Defaults to 65536.
        //maxDexPoolSize = 65536

        // The package name of the used DexPatcher annotations. Useful to handle rogue apps
        // that want to disallow patching by intentionally clashing with standard DexPatcher
        // annotation names. Defaults to 'lanchon.dexpatcher.annotation'.
        //annotationPackage = 'lanchon.dexpatcher.annotation'

        // Enable compatibility with the deprecated DexTag.
        //compatDexTag = true

        // The verbosity of the DexPatcher tool. One of QUIET, NORMAL, VERBOSE or DEBUG.
        // Defaults to NORMAL, but VERBOSE is recommended.
        //verbosity = VERBOSE

        // Enable logging of relative paths of source files instead of just their filename.
        //logSourcePath = true

        // Enable logging of paths of source files prepending the specified root.
        //logSourcePathRoot = file('src/main/java')
