// DexPatcher APK Library plugin:

apply plugin: 'com.github.lanchon.dexpatcher.apk-library'

// The DexPatcher APK Library plugin processes a source application provided as an
// Android APK and produces a DexPatcher APK library. The library is used to create
// modified versions of the source application and includes its Dalvik bytecode and
// decoded manifest and resources.

dependencies {
    // The source application is defined as a Gradle dependency.

    // It is defined either as an Android APK dependency:
    //sourceApk fileTree(dir: 'apk', include: ['*.apk', '*.jar', '*.zip'])

    // Or as a DexPatcher APK library dependency:
    sourceApkLibrary fileTree(dir: 'apklib', include: ['*.apklib'])

    // The contents of the 'apk' and 'apklib' project subdirectories are included in
    // these configurations by default. Exactly one source application dependency
    // must be available to the build.
}

// General Plugin Configuration
